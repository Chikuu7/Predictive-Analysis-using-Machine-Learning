🤖 Task 2 – Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

📘 Overview

The objective of this task is to build a Machine Learning (ML) model capable of predicting outcomes based on a given dataset.
This project focuses on developing an end-to-end predictive pipeline—from data preprocessing and feature selection to model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.
It demonstrates practical understanding of supervised learning techniques, enabling data-driven predictions that can assist in real-world decision-making.

🎯 Goals

Explore and preprocess a real-world dataset.

Apply supervised machine learning algorithms for prediction.

Understand feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

Visualize results and interpret model insights effectively.

🧮 Workflow

Data Loading and Exploration

Import dataset (Student_Performance.csv).

Display initial records and check for null or missing values.

Generate summary statistics and visualize relationships among features.

Data Preprocessing

Encode categorical variables (if any).

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Scale features using StandardScaler for model consistency.

Feature Selection and Engineering

Identify key predictors influencing the target variable (Grades).

Remove redundant or less significant features to improve performance.

Model Development

Implement a Linear Regression model to predict student grades.

Fit the model to the training data and generate predictions on the test set.

Model Evaluation

Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score to measure accuracy.

Visualize model performance with Actual vs Predicted plots and feature importance charts.

Insights Generation

Identify the most influential features (e.g., study hours, attendance, parental support).

Analyze how each factor contributes to student grade performance.

📊 Example Use Case

Predicting student performance based on study habits, attendance, and demographic factors.
The model helps identify students at risk of underperforming, allowing early intervention and personalized guidance.

🧾 Deliverables

A Jupyter Notebook / Colab file containing:

Data exploration and cleaning steps.

Model training, evaluation, and visualizations.

A README section summarizing dataset, algorithm used, and insights.

💡 Expected Outcome

By completing this task, you’ll demonstrate:

The ability to build and evaluate predictive ML models.

Strong understanding of data preprocessing, model selection, and validation.

Skills in interpreting data-driven insights for informed decision-making.

Practical exposure to regression analysis in real-world datasets.
